* **What is the next number in the series?**  
  7, 26, 63, 124, 215, ...?

1. 342
2. 343
3. 344
4. 345

## Answer

* Attempt finding an arithmatic progression:
  
  ```math
    7 * 4 -  2 = 26
   26 * 3 - 15 = 63
   63 * 2 -  2 = 124
  124 * 2 - 33 = 215 
  ```

  this is going nowhere...

* notice this, add up the digits:
  
  ```math
    7 -> 7         =  7
   26 -> 2 + 6     =  8
   63 -> 6 + 3     =  9
  124 -> 1 + 2 + 4 =  7
  215 -> 2 + 1 + 5 =  8

  342 -> 3 + 4 + 2 =  9 ***
  343 -> 3 + 4 + 3 = 10
  344 -> 3 + 4 + 4 = 11
  345 -> 3 + 4 + 5 = 12
  ```

here we have a possible answer: `1. 342`
