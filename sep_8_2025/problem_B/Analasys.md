# Full problem Analysis

1. **The "Mix" box must be mislabeled.** Since all labels are wrong, the "Mix" box can't actually contain a mix of apples and oranges. It must contain either only apples or only oranges.

2. **A single pick from the "Mix" box reveals everything.** By picking one fruit
   from the "Mix" box, you immediately know its true contents.

   - If you pick an **_apple_**, you know the box labeled "Mix" actually contains **_Apples_**.

   - If you pick an **_orange_**, you know the box labeled "Mix" actually contains
     **_Oranges_**.

3. **Relabeling based on the first pick.**

- Let's say you picked an **_apple_** from the "Mix" box.

  - The box labeled "Mix" is now correctly labeled **_Apples_**.

  - Now consider the other two boxes: "Apples" and "Oranges." The box labeled
    **_"Apples"_** can't contain apples (since the labels are all wrong), so it must
    contain **_Oranges_**.

  - That leaves the box labeled **_"Oranges"_**. By process of elimination, this box
    must contain the **_mix_**.

You can apply the same logic if you had picked an orange from the "Mix" box.  

By **starting with the box that can only contain one type of fruit**, you gain the single piece of information needed to deduce the contents of all three boxes.
