# Problem B: Labeled Boxes (Logic Puzzle)

## Problem Statement

Three boxes are labeled: Apples, Oranges, Mix (Apples & Oranges). All labels
are wrong. You may pick one fruit from one box.

- Which box do you choose from?
- How do you relabel correctly?

## Answer to Puzzle

**Which box do you choose from?**

Choose the box labeled **_Mix_**.

This is the only box that can give you a definitive answer with a single pick. Since all the labels are wrong, the "Mix" box cannot contain a mix of apples and oranges. It must contain only apples or only oranges.

**How do you relabel correctly?**

1. **Pick one fruit from the "Mix" box.**

   - If you pick an **_apple_**, you know this box actually contains only **_apples_**.

   - If you pick an **_orange_**, you know this box actually contains only **_oranges_**.

2. **Relabel the "Mix" box and the "Apples" box.**

   - Let's assume you picked an **_apple_**. You know the box labeled "Mix" is actually the **_Apples_** box.

   - Now, look at the box labeled "Apples." Since all labels are wrong, this box _cannot contain apples_. It must contain **_oranges_**.

   - This leaves the box labeled "Oranges." By process of elimination, this box must contain the **_mix_**.

3. **Finalize your labels.**

   - The box you started with (labeled "Mix") is now correctly labeled **_Apples_**.

   - The box originally labeled "Apples" is now correctly labeled **_Oranges_**.

   - The box originally labeled "Oranges" is now correctly labeled **_Mix_**.

This process works because a single, strategic pick from the "Mix" box creates a chain reaction of deductions that correctly identifies the contents of all three boxes.
